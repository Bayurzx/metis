## Why?
### *Other than Blockchain is awesome???*
Do you get on Reddit and Quora and all you see is fan wars... right ðŸ˜…, I mean, If you are so passionate about something, you might as well make money from it... **ðŸ˜‹**

# What It Does???
`Stoked` gives you a chance to stake on your picks and win. Your picks are displayed for voting and best option wins the vote.

When the voting ends, one lucky winner from the voters keeps the entire bag ðŸ’° if the vote limit has been reached.

# How Do You Get on Board???
Simply by joining the Metis community. Your passport to vote is simply switching to the [Metis network](https://docs.metis.io/building-on-metis/connection-details)  (*Still testing on the Metis Rinkeby Testnet at the time of this wrting*).

# How we built it???
![Architecture Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bayurzx/metis/master/screenshots/Your%20recc.png)

The app was built with the help of the `React` Library and the [Metis Polis](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit). It's currently on the Metis Rinkeby Testnet migrating to [Stardust Testnet](https://stardust-explorer.metis.io/) soon

The application is accessible to users with Metamask using the Rinkeby Network.
