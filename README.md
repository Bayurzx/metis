# Your Recommedation (Celo)

Help end all disagreements with a simple click of a button!

## Check it here:
[Your Reccomendation](https://your-recommendation.netlify.app/)

## Why?
### *Other than Blockchain is awesome???*
Do you get on Reddit and Quora and all you see is fan wars... right ðŸ˜…, I mean, If you are so passionate about something, you might as well make money from it... **ðŸ˜‹**

# What It Does???
`Your Recommendation` gives you a chance stake on your picks and win. Your picks are displayed for voting and best option wins the vote.

When the voting ends, one lucky winner from the voters keeps the entire bag ðŸ’° if the vote limit has been reached.

# How Do You Get on Board???
Simply by joining the celo community. Your passport to vote is simply switching to the [celo network](https://medium.com/defi-for-the-people/how-to-set-up-metamask-with-celo-912d698fcafe)  (*Testnet at the time of this wrting*) or download the Celo-wallet extension on chrome. 

# How we built it???
![Architecture Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bayurzx/dapp_react/master/screenshots/Your%20recc.png)

The app was built with the help of the `React` Library and the [ContractKit SDK](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit). It's currently on the [Alfajores Testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet)

The application is accessible to users with both Celo-wallet extension and on Metamask using the celo Alfajores Network making it **accessible even on mobile phones**

**DO NOT USE THIS APP ON YOUR MAINNET**


### Usage
- Install the CeloExtensionWallet from the google chrome store.
  - Or, connect to the celo network on Metamask, Yes it is metamask accessible. For more info: [Metamask on Celo Network](https://medium.com/defi-for-the-people/how-to-set-up-metamask-with-celo-912d698fcafe)
- For new users, reate a wallet 
- Go to https://celo.org/developers/faucet and get tokens for the alfajores testnet.
- Switch to the alfajores testnet in the CeloExtensionWallet.

## Developer tools and useful resources

This section contains information about some of the key tools and resources that will help developers start building applications on Celo.

For a comprehensive list of resources and information, review [Celo Docs.](https://docs.celo.org/)

### QUICK START GUIDES

View the [Developer Code Examples page](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/start) to get started using the Celo SDKs with guided coding exercises.

### TOOLS

#### SDKs

-   [ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit)
-   Javascript package of Celo blockchain utilities
-   Manage connections to the Celo blockchain, accounts, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, etc.
-   A set of wrappers around the core protocol smart contracts to easily connect with contracts related to governance, validators, on-chain exchange, etc.
-   Includes [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/)
-   [Celo Ethers.js Wrapper](https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper) (experimental)
-   A minimal wrapper to make [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) compatible with the Celo network
-   [use-contractkit](https://github.com/celo-tools/use-contractkit)
-   A [Web3Modal](https://web3modal.com/)-like experience that injects ContractKit into your web-based application. Supports a variety of different wallets, including but not limited to Valora, Ledger, Metamask (Celo compatible fork) and any WalletConnect compatible wallets
-   [DappKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/dappkit)
-   Easily connect to the [Valora](http://valoraapp.com/) wallet with your React Native mobile application
-   Valora manages user account, private keys and transaction signing, so you can focus on building your dapp
-   Learn more and see the code with the [Dappkit truffle box](https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-dappkit)
-   [Python SDK](https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-py)
-   [Java SDK](https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-java)


#### Infrastructure

-   [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) provides a clean, intuitive UI where users can send transactions and interact with smart contracts
-   [Forno](https://stackedit.io/developer-guide/forno)
-   Node access service so you can connect your dapp to the Celo blockchain without having to run node infrastructure
-   [ODIS](https://stackedit.io/developer-resources/contractkit/odis.md)
-   Oblivious decentralized identity service
-   Lightweight identity layer that makes it easy to send cryptocurrency to a phone number
-   Blockscout block explorers
-   [Alfajores testnet](http://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) & [mainnet](http://explorer.celo.org/)
-   [Stats.celo.org](http://stats.celo.org/) to check network activity and health


#### Networks

-   [Alfajores Testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet)
-   [Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) for free testnet CELO and cUSD
-   [Forno](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno) supports connections to alfajores
-   Requires Alfajores Celo wallet for mobile device testing (please request, support@clabs.co)
-   [Baklava testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet) for validators and testing protocol changes


#### Ethereum Tools

-   Similarities between Celo and Ethereum means you can use many of the most popular Ethereum developer tools.
-   Celo supports the EVM, so tools for writing smart contracts in Solidity (or any language that compiles to EVM bytecode) are compatible with Celo
-   ERC20, NFT (ERC721) and other smart contract interface standards are supported, see [Celo for Ethereum Developers](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/celo-for-eth-devs)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
